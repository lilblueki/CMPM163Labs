For the cube furthest to the left, I interpolated between green and pink using my own shaders.
The cube in the center of the screen is the cube with a green specular highlight made with three.js phong material.
The cube closest to the right, I interpolated between pink and red following the lab tutorial on how to build a shader/using my own shader.
The cube floating towards the bottom left corner is a cube with a purple base, and a orange specular highlight made with three.js phong material.
The cube floating towards the top right corner is a cube with a navy blue base, and a yellow specular highlight made with three.js phong material.
