For the cube furthest to the left, I interpolated between green and pink using my own shaders.
The cube in the center of the screen is the cube with a green specular highlight made with three.js phong material.
The cube closest to the right, I interpolated between pink and red following the lab tutorial on how to build a shader/using my own shader.
The cube floating towards the bottom left corner is a cube with a purple base, and a orange specular highlight made with three.js phong material.
The cube floating towards the top right corner is a cube with a navy blue base, and a yellow specular highlight made with three.js phong material.

a) What is a formula to get the x coordinate of the texture given a u value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1)?
  - x = 
  
b) What is a formula to get the y coordinate of the texture given a v value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1)?
  
  
c)What color is sampled from the texture at the uv coordinate (0.375, 0.25)? (sample from the image based on the number your formula gives you i.e. (1, 0) (x, y) is blue)
